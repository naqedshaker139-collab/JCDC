# Proposed Technology Stack

For the equipment management website, I propose the following technology stack:

*   **Backend:** Flask (a Python web framework)
*   **Frontend:** React (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
*   **Database:** SQLite (a lightweight, serverless SQL database)

## Rationale

*   **Flask** is a lightweight and flexible Python framework that is well-suited for small to medium-sized web applications. It is easy to learn and use, and it has a large and active community. For multilingual support, we can use the `Flask-Babel` extension.

*   **React** is a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building modern, interactive user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which will help in building a consistent and maintainable frontend. We can use a library like `react-i18next` for handling translations on the client-side.

*   **SQLite** is a simple, file-based database that is perfect for this project's needs. It doesn't require a separate server process and is easy to set up and manage. It's a good choice for applications with a limited number of users and data, which is the case here.

This stack is a good combination of simplicity, power, and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for this project.
